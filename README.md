# Non Existant Time Theory
WIP Notes of Non-existant Time Theory.

# Observations
1. Time does not exist.
2. Time is an artifact of motion in space dimension.  
   - eg) in Nth dimension, the motion of an object in space creates an illustration of time.
3. One should not use time as a point of reference in space dimension.
4. With an instrument in Nth dimension space, 
   One can create a zero-time gap between dimension-location A1 and A2, without a space travel.
   - eg) let t1 is observed at a1, and let t2 is observed at a2.
   - eg) with any instrument at a2, a1 @ t1 can be observed by a2 @ t2.
5. The zero-time gap seems uni-directional.
   - Q1: Can a1 @ t1 observe a2 @ t2 with an instrument of t2 in a2 space dimension?
   - Q2: How does the a2 instrument allows the direct link between a2 and a2 space, without space travel?

6. Given: t2 is later time than t1.
   - Observation: 
   - T2 isn't observed yet.
   - T1 is observed, or happened.
   - At T2, an event is injected at T1 by observation.
   - Then, T1' is observed.
   - T1 no longer exists.
   - T1 != T1'
   - Summary: Future A2 can change the past A1, by observation.
   - Sideline: A2 observation in N-dimension does not remember t1, but t1'.
   
   
7. A1 @ t1 can participate in the observation made by A2 @ t2.
   - Q: An object in A1 can be a non-living thing, by our normal definition?
