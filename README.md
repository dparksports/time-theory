# Non Existant Time Theory
Notes of Non-existant Time Theory.

# Observations
1. Time does not exist.
2. Time is an artifact of motion in space dimension.  
   - eg) in Nth dimension, the motion of an object in space creates an illustration of time.
3. One should not use time as a point of reference in space dimension.
4. With an instrument in Nth dimension space, 
   One can narrow the gap in dimension-location A1 and A2, without a space travel.
   - eg) let t1 is observed at a1, and let t2 is observed at a2.
   - eg) with any instrument at a2, a1 @ t1 can be observed by a2 @ t2.
   
# Questions   
1. Can a1 @ t1 observe a2 @ t2 with an instrument of t2 in a2 space dimension?
2. How does the a2 instrument allows the direct link between a2 and a2 space, without space travel?
